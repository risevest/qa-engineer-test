# QA Engineer Test - Risevest Web App

**Objective:**

This test assesses your ability to design and implement automated tests for web applications. You will be evaluating the functionality of the Risevest Web App ([https://app.risevest.com](https://app.risevest.com)) by creating an automated test/script.

**Requirements:**

Your automated test/script should cover the following user flows:

1. **Login:**
    - Successfully log in to the Risevest Web App using valid credentials.
    - Handle invalid credentials (incorrect username/password) and verify appropriate error messages.
2. **View Wallet:**
    - Access the wallet section of the application.
    - Verify that the wallet balance is displayed correctly.
3. **Show/Hide Wallet Balance:**
    - Test the functionality that allows users to show or hide their wallet balance.
    - Ensure the balance is hidden/shown as expected when the corresponding button/toggle is clicked.
4. **View Plans:**
    - Navigate to the section where users can view their investment plans.
    - Verify that existing plans (if any) are displayed correctly with relevant details.
5. **Create a Plan:**
    - Complete the process of creating a new investment plan.
    - This includes filling in the required information (e.g., amount, investment type) and submitting the form.
    - Verify that the new plan is successfully created and displayed in the list of plans.

**Technical Considerations:**

- You are free to use any programming language and testing framework of your choice. (e.g., Selenium with Java/Python, Cypress, Playwright)
- Your test should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.
- Include clear comments to explain the purpose and functionality of different parts of your code.
- Implement proper error handling and reporting mechanisms.
- Consider using a Page Object Model (POM) or a similar design pattern to improve code organization and reusability.

**Bonus Points:**

- Implement data-driven testing to test with different sets of input data.
- Include assertions to validate the expected behavior of the application.
- Generate a test report summarizing the test execution results.
- Consider cross-browser compatibility testing (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

**Submission:**

- Submit your code in a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) and share with us.
- Include a README file in your repository with instructions on how to run your test.

**Time Duration:** 1 week

**Evaluation Criteria:**

- **Functionality:** Does the test cover all the required user flows and functionalities?
- **Accuracy:** Does the test accurately validate the expected behavior of the application?
- **Reliability:** Is the test consistent and reliable in its execution and results?
- **Code Quality:** Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
- **Test Reporting:** Is the test report clear, concise, and informative?

This test is designed to assess your practical skills and understanding of automated testing principles. We encourage you to demonstrate your best work and showcase your ability to deliver high-quality automated tests. Good luck!
